Further instructions for MOCA artifact evaluators

* Problem cloning forked FireSim repository
If there's problem cloning forked version of FireSim, please clone the recent FireSim repository, and check-out MOCA branch for Gemmini and gemmini-rocc-tests inside gemmini/software. If you are manually checking out Gemmini MoCA branches on default FireSim, you would also need to change RocketConfigs.scala (https://github.com/SeahK/chipyard/blob/4e7fe79e5947e425365cf0db46599d9b40a829d2/generators/chipyard/src/main/scala/config/RocketConfigs.scala#L53) and TargetConfigs.scala
(https://github.com/SeahK/chipyard/blob/4e7fe79e5947e425365cf0db46599d9b40a829d2/generators/firechip/src/main/scala/TargetConfigs.scala#L205).


* Problem compiling / running the binaries
If there's any issue compiling and running the binaries, or do not want to compile binaries yourself, please try downloading the pre-built binaries that we have ran while preparing AE. We verified that the artifacts build and run without issue with reasonable results more than 5 consecutive turns prior to the AE submission, but just in case, would provide the latest pre-built binaries and FireSim run result.
- Pre-built binaries: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lNTEzUE_Loi3q_4Gy4ZqBiIgNoc2kZnT/view?usp=sharing
- The result of running these binaries is here: https://github.com/SeahK/firesim/tree/main/deploy/results-workload, under EXAMPLE_RESULT
You can obtain result of the provided binary (above) by following these steps:
1) Download, unzip and place this under gemmini/software/overlay/root, so that overlay/root/imagenet would have 18 -linux binaries.
2) Run these commands:
cd /home/centos/firesim/sw/firesim-software/
rm images/gemmini-tests-workload*
./marshal -v --workdir /home/centos/firesim/target-design/chipyard/generators/gemmini/software
 build gemmini-tests-workload.json
./marshal -v --workdir /home/centos/firesim/target-design/chipyard/generators/gemmini/software
 install gemmini-tests-workload.json


* Need more detailed instruction of setting up config_runtime, config_hwdb to launch FireSim runs
1) On config_hwdb.yaml in firesim/deploy, add the following texts at the end of the .yaml file:
firesim_eightcore_gemmini_moca:
    agfi: agfi-001bd1f383ffdd9ff
    deploy_triplet_override: null
    custom_runtime_config: null
2) On config_runtime.yaml, change like following:
    run_farm_hosts_to_use:
      - f1.16xlarge: 0
      - f1.4xlarge: 0
      - f1.2xlarge: 3
      - m4.16xlarge: 0
      - z1d.3xlarge: 0
      - z1d.6xlarge: 0
      - z1d.12xlarge: 0

    target_config:
        topology: three_no_net_config
        no_net_num_nodes: 3
        link_latency: 6405
        switching_latency: 10
        net_bandwidth: 200
        profile_interval: -1

    default_hw_config: firesim_eightcore_gemmini_moca

    workload:
        workload_name: gemmini-tests-workload.json
        terminate_on_completion: no
        suffix_tag: null
